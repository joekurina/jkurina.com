        <p>Here&rsquo;s a list of some of the projects I&rsquo;m working on. I&rsquo;ll get a feed of posts associated with each up on here soon, but for now you can take a look at my github or send me an email.</p>
<h1 id="acceleration-of-homomorphic-encryption-primitives-using-oneapi-an-fpga-and-a-gpu">Acceleration of Homomorphic Encryption Primitives Using OneAPI, an FPGA, and a GPU</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be basing my Master&rsquo;s Thesis on this project. I&rsquo;m working with Professor Sunny Kim, who&rsquo;s now at the Rochester Insitute of Technology, and some engineers at Intel to accelerate homomorphic encryption primitives in a heterogeneous compute environment.</p>
<h1 id="homomorphic-encryption-in-general">Homomorphic Encryption in General</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in applications of HE, specifically in embedded systems. In addition to my thesis work exploring acceleration using PCIE devices, I&rsquo;m also exploring projects that implement HE on microcontrollers and smaller FPGA development boards.</p>
<h1 id="hardware-security--breaking-things">Hardware Security &amp; Breaking Things</h1>
<p>Dovetailing with my interest in homomorphic encryption, I&rsquo;m also interested in hardware security. I plan on doing some research and projects in this area and posting about the things I&rsquo;m learning. My buddy Jos came to visit from the Netherlands this last summer and gave me the encouragement I needed to pivot into this field. (Who knew that you should be pursuing your interests!?)</p>
<h1 id="freertos-and-zephyr">FreeRTOS and Zephyr</h1>
<p>I have a few development boards that I&rsquo;d like to get up and running with FreeRTOS and Zephyr. The plan here is to get a couple build setups going to serve as scaffolding for future projects/boards. I&rsquo;ll be posting about this work mostly for myself, as a form of running-commentary-as-documentation, but if anyone else finds it useful, that&rsquo;s great too.</p>
<h1 id="ambient-synthesizer-noodling">Ambient Synthesizer Noodling</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been bitten by the Eurorack bug, so I&rsquo;m one of those guys. Relative to some, my &ldquo;gear acquisition syndrome&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t as bad as it could be, but I still consider my setup a &ldquo;work-in-progress&rdquo;. Since I&rsquo;m an EE by training, the plan was to DIY as much as possible, but this hobby hasn&rsquo;t entirely gone according to plan.</p>
<h1 id="becoming-a-vim-guy">Becoming a Vim-guy.</h1>
<p>A big part of me wants to go the Emacs route, just for the sake of going against the grain, but it seems like everyone&rsquo;s using NeoVim nowadays and I&rsquo;m not terribly interested in making things too difficult for myself. Most of my work is done in C, on some sort of UNIX-based system, and I spend most of my time in the terminal anyhow, so I might as well bite the bullet and document my foibles here. Hell, I might even try out one of those tiling window managers that are all the rage&hellip; Don&rsquo;t worry though, I&rsquo;m sticking to Ubuntu LTS and Debian, I&rsquo;m not a gamer and I don&rsquo;t need to be running bleeding-edge anything. Who has the time?</p>
<h1 id="this-website">This Website!</h1>
<p>I am not a web developer and I do not want to be a web developer, but I need a website. This site is a bit of a compromise, a little more involved than a pre-made WYSIWYG solution and something I don&rsquo;t have to actively maintain. It&rsquo;s been a bit of a headache getting here so far, but it&rsquo;s a small price to pay for simplicity! I&rsquo;ll be sure to tell you all about it in the coming posts!</p>
