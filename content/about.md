My name is Joe and this is my site.

I'm an embedded systems engineer and a masters student with an interest in security, cryptography, and reverse engineering.

I'll be using this site to post about my projects and other things I find interesting.

# About The Site
I've built this using the Hugo static site generator and the Risotto theme. My plan is to learn a bit more about web development and use this as a basis for extending the theme.
As of right now, I've chosen to not use any javascript, so it's all just HTML and CSS. I appreciate the simplicity of this approach -- no databases, no server-side code, just a bunch of static files served to you by a CDN. Why make things more complicated than they need to be? I'm not selling you anything and there's no web-apps here. I'm not interested in hosting comments or tracking you, the less I know the better; but if you'd like to get in touch, please reach out over email.

# My Cats
Here's a photo of my new kittens. They're adorable and I love them.

# Rest In Peace Pon Sept. 2007 to Sept. 2024
Pon was my beloved companion of 17 years. She was a beautiful and neurotic little girl and my shadow around the house.
She wasn't friendly to everyone, but was a memorable cat. Those she liked were blessed with her affection.
She's missed dearly.
