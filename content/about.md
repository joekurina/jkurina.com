My name is Joe and this is my site.

I'm an embedded systems engineer and a masters student with an interest in security, cryptography, and reverse engineering.

I'll be using this site to post about my projects and other things I find interesting.

# About The Site
I've built this using the Hugo static site generator and the Risotto theme. It's deployed as an app on DigitalOcean's app platform which monitors my github repo and rebuilds the site every time I push to it... How cool is that? My plan is to learn a bit more about web development and use this as a basis for extending the theme. As of right now, I've chosen to not use any javascript\*, so it's all just HTML and CSS. I appreciate the simplicity of this approach -- no databases, no server-side code, just a bunch of static files served to you by a CDN. Why make things more complicated than they need to be? I'm not selling you anything and there's no web-apps here. I'm not interested in hosting comments or tracking you, the less I know the better; but if you'd like to get in touch, please reach out over email.

\* I have found that the CDN automatically embeds a little js into the pages that it serves to scramble my email address for bot-scrapers. That seems inoffensive enough to me. I might later chose to include some js for prettying up code snippets in my posts, but if I can get away with just using HTML and CSS, I'm gonna stick with that.

# My Cats
Here's a photo of my new kittens. They're adorable and I love them.

# Rest In Peace Pon Sept. 2007 to Sept. 2024
Pon was my beloved companion of 17 years. She was a beautiful and neurotic little girl and my shadow around the house.
She wasn't friendly to everyone, but was a memorable cat. Those she liked were blessed with her affection.
She's missed dearly.
