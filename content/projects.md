Here's a list of some of the projects I'm working on. I'll get a feed of posts associated with each up on here soon, but for now you can take a look at my github or send me an email.

# Acceleration of Homomorphic Encryption Primitives Using OneAPI, an FPGA, and a GPU
I'm going to be basing my Master's Thesis on this project. I'm working with Professor Sunny Kim, who's now at the Rochester Insitute of Technology, and some engineers at Intel to accelerate homomorphic encryption primitives in a heterogeneous compute environment.

# Homomorphic Encryption in General
I'm interested in applications of HE, specifically in embedded systems. In addition to my thesis work exploring acceleration using PCIE devices, I'm also exploring projects that implement HE on microcontrollers and smaller FPGA development boards.

# Hardware Security & Breaking Things
Dovetailing with my interest in homomorphic encryption, I'm also interested in hardware security. I plan on doing some research and projects in this area and posting about the things I'm learning. My buddy Jos came to visit from the Netherlands this last summer and gave me the encouragement I needed to pivot into this field. (Who knew that you should be pursuing your interests!?)

# FreeRTOS and Zephyr
I have a few development boards that I'd like to get up and running with FreeRTOS and Zephyr. The plan here is to get a couple build setups going to serve as scaffolding for future projects/boards. I'll be posting about this work mostly for myself, as a form of running-commentary-as-documentation, but if anyone else finds it useful, that's great too.

# Ambient Synthesizer Noodling
I've been bitten by the Eurorack bug, so I'm one of those guys. Relative to some, my "gear acquisition syndrome" isn't as bad as it could be, but I still consider my setup a "work-in-progress". Since I'm an EE by training, the plan was to DIY as much as possible, but this hobby hasn't entirely gone according to plan.

# Becoming a Vim-guy.
A big part of me wants to go the Emacs route, just for the sake of going against the grain, but it seems like everyone's using NeoVim nowadays and I'm not terribly interested in making things too difficult for myself. Most of my work is done in C, on some sort of UNIX-based system, and I spend most of my time in the terminal anyhow, so I might as well bite the bullet and document my foibles here. Hell, I might even try out one of those tiling window managers that are all the rage... Don't worry though, I'm sticking to Ubuntu LTS and Debian, I'm not a gamer and I don't need to be running bleeding-edge anything. Who has the time?

# This Website!
I am not a web developer and I do not want to be a web developer, but I need a website. This site is a bit of a compromise, a little more involved than a pre-made WYSIWYG solution and something I don't have to actively maintain. It's been a bit of a headache getting here so far, but it's a small price to pay for simplicity! I'll be sure to tell you all about it in the coming posts!
