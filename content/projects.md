Here's a list of some of the projects I'm working on. I'll get a feed of posts associated with each up on here soon, but for now you can take a look at my github or send me an email.

# Acceleration of Homomorphic Encryption Primitives Using OneAPI, an FPGA, and a GPU
I'm going to be basing my Master's Thesis on this project. I'm working with Professor Sunny Kim, who's now at the Rochester Insitute of Technology, and some engineers at Intel to accelerate homomorphic encryption primitives in a heterogeneous compute environment.

# Homomorphic Encryption in General
I'm interested in applications of HE, specifically in embedded systems. In addition to my thesis work exploring acceleration using PCIE devices, I'm also exploring projects that implement HE on microcontrollers and smaller FPGA development boards.

# Hardware Security & Breaking Things
Dovetailing with my interest in homomorphic encryption, I'm also interested in hardware security. I plan on doing some research and projects in this area and posting about the things I'm learning. My buddy Jos came to visit from the Netherlands this last summer and gave me the encouragement I needed to pivot into this field. (Who knew that you should be pursuing your interests!?)

# FreeRTOS and Zephyr
I have a few development boards that I'd like to get up and running with FreeRTOS and Zephyr. The plan here is to get a couple build setups going to serve as scaffolding for future projects/boards. I'll be posting about this work mostly for myself, as a form of running-commentary-as-documentation, but if anyone else finds it useful, that's great too.

# Ambient Synthesizer Noodling
I've been bitten by the Eurorack bug, so I'm one of those guys. Relative to some, my "gear acquisition syndrome" isn't as bad as it could be, but I still consider my setup a "work-in-progress". Since I'm an EE by training, the plan was to DIY as much as possible, but this hobby hasn't entirely gone according to plan.

# Becoming a Vim-guy
I think it's completely derranged that the most popular editor these days is basically a web browser at its core. A big part of me wants to go the Emacs route, just for the sake of going against the grain, but it seems like everyone's using NeoVim nowadays and I'm not terribly interested in making things any more difficult for myself. Most of my work is done in C on some sort of UNIX-based system, and I spend most of my time in the terminal anyhow, so I might as well bite the bullet and document my foibles here. Maybe I'll continue to shed most of my gui interfaces in time and become one of those tiling window manager guys, too. In any case, I'm not terribly excited about the prospect, but if I'm going to complain about the status quo I ought to be practicing what I preach. 

# This Website!
I am not a web developer and I do not want to be a web developer, but I need a website. This site is a bit of a compromise, a little more involved than a pre-made WYSIWYG solution but also something I don't have to actively maintain beyond pushing to the github repo. As I said on the 'About' page, I just want to serve you HTML and CSS -- pictures, audio, and text is all you'll get from me! It's been a bit of a headache getting here so far, but it's a small price to pay for simplicity! I'll be sure to tell you all about it in the coming posts!
